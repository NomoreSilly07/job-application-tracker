Day 3 – Resume After Work Gap

- Had 2 days of work pressure during my internship.
- Resumed learning with Spring Boot fundamentals.
- Understood how Java classes and methods are exposed as REST APIs.
- Learned the role of @RestController and @GetMapping.

Key takeaway:
Consistency means returning after a break, not never missing a day.
